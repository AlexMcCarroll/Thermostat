## Challenge Instructions:
You'll then build the business logic to model a simple thermostat, and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. Finally, you'll use JavaScript to fetch data from external sources and display that on the page - again, all right from the page. Underpinning all this will be a new testing framework to help you test-drive your JavaScript code - Jasmine.

## Skills Required:
Learnt how to use JavaScript, jQuery, and Jasmine in one week to:
- Build a full stack, JavaScript application
